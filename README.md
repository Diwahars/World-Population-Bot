# World-Population-Bot
A Twitter bot that posts the total world population and the percent change once a day.

**NOTE:** Before using makesure log.txt has at least 2 world population already. To determine the 2 previous days world population use: http://api.population.io/#!/population/determineTotalPopulationByDate and put the two numbers you find into log.txt.

Enjoy!
