# World-Population-Bot
*A simple Twitter bot that posts the total world population and the percent change once a day.*

**What this program does:**
1. Pull the total world population from http://api.population.io/
2. Calculate the percent change since the previous day
3. Post to twitter
4. Wait 24 hours
5. Repeat

**NOTE:** Before using makesure log.txt has at least 2 world population already. To determine the 2 previous days world population use: http://api.population.io/#!/population/determineTotalPopulationByDate and put the two numbers you find into log.txt.

Enjoy!
